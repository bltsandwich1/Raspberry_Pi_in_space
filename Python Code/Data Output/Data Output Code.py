###This code represents the framework off which we will work off of
###The code refrenses files that are in the Data Read in directory
###It reads those files then send them to the ??????

import time

t = time.clock() #!# I don't want to use this module, but need to look up the replacement

while (): #!! This may end up being an if loop
	
	
	TMP = open('sole_temp', 'r+'
	TMP.seek(2, xxxxx) #!# test the data file and see the character count on an output stream
	TMP.read() #!#syntax
	if(): ### Loop for data output via ?????
		
		
	
	
	BMP = open('flight_temps_press', 'r+')
	BMP.seek(2, xxxxx)
	BMP.read() #syntax This should be saved as a variable?, str?
	if(): ### Data output look
